    next step is creating a format that can be used to study the effects of a disaster event. We decided
to first test out making timelines of GDELT events following each disaster event. In the first version,
these timelines start out with a single disaster event, then contain all GDELT (protest/humanitarian aid) events
in the following year within 80 kilometers. This method yielded 5,349 individual timelines, with the following
statistics: an average of 22.59 events per timeline, median number of 6.0 events per timeline, a maximum of 302
events in a timeline, a minimum of 1 event in a timeline, and a standard deviation of 41.86 between timelines.
By looking at the difference between the mean and the median, we can see that our timelines are skewed to the
right, meaning we have a few very large timelines, which are most likely from events occurring in urban centers
where there would be more GDELT events. The next step is to experiment with different attributes to see their
effects on the timelines by creating variations of these timelines with different parameters, which is what the
following subsections focus on.
